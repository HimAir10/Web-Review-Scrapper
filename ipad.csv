ipad,Pratik  Pawar,5,Super!,"I have been using the iPad 10 for over 5-6 months. I bought this one again for my niece who threw tantrums at me when she saw my iPad. In my experience of using an iPad for the first time, this one was as fast as my iPhone 14, clicked decent document pictures, is able to play heavy mobile games like Genshin Impact, has a never dying battery,and has a nice big display. What else do you want??"
ipad,vishal bhardwaj,5,Terrific,If you are student want to make notes than go for it and the best advantage is that all third party pencils under 2k work perfectly on it personally I am using ESR pencil which is very great and giving great results.  If you are worring of the display gap than there's no need to be afraid or agonised about it as You use the ipad u get adapted to it and no problem occurs in it.  So go for it Without any hesitation.
